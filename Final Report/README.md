# Abstract:
Pablo Fernandez (2018) (“It has been very easy to beat the S&P500 in 2010-2018. Several Examples”)
stated that he built up 12 portfolios that, investing $100 in January 2000 became, on average $26,749
(266.49% total return) in April 2018, and these portfolios were composed following very simple rules:
1. Diversification is a must
2. A portfolio of small (market-cap) companies has outperformed long-term a portfolio of big
companies
3. Unweighted indexes have outperformed weighted indexes

In this article, I will try to duplicate the investment strategies from Pablo Fernandez’s paper, and
implement these strategies to Taiwan stock market through backtesting, we will see whether these
strategies work well with Taiwan stock market.
